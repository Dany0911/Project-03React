React Front-End for REST API
Project Overview:
This is the third project of the course FullStackDeveloper at Laurea University.
This React application provides a front-end interface for managing blog subscribers via a REST API. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and search for specific subscribers. The app is styled using Bootstrap and includes intuitive navigation features.

Features:
Data Display on Load: Displays a list of subscribers when the page loads.
Subscriber Management: Users can add new subscribers with details (Name, Email, Channel, Topic), view individual subscriber details, edit information, and delete entries.
Search Functionality: Includes a search bar to filter subscribers by name.
Full API Utilization: The app uses all available REST API paths for comprehensive functionality.
Technologies Used
React: Front-end framework.
Bootstrap: For responsive and styled UI components.
Axios: For API requests.
Node.js & Express (back-end): REST API implementation.
Mongoose (back-end): Database.

Important Note:
To run the application without errors, please ensure you have a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) extension enabled in your browser. This is necessary because the REST API was deployed on Render, and modifying the deployed code to handle CORS directly wasnâ€™t possible. Using a CORS add-on will facilitate smooth communication between the React front-end and the API.
If doesn't work on Render build it and run it locally.
